# SafeSubscripts

This package lets you use use Swift subscripts safely.

Sick and tired of your code crashing when an invalid index is selected? Isn't Swift _supposed_ to be all about safety?

Well, here's where this tool comes in.

Now, when using the `safe: ` prefix on your subscripts when accessing indices in an array, you're now returned an optional, and nonexistent results return nil. This effectively matches the behavior of Swift Dictionaries, for example.

```Swift
let array = [1, 2, 3]

guard let value = array[safe: 3] else { // Oops! The index here only goes up to 2.
    return // Fail gracefully
}
```

As for why this isn't the default behavior in Swift, I imagine it's for backwards compatibility reasons. It's not what I prefer, though, hence why I made this.

Go ahead, `guard let` your arrays to your Swifty heart's content! ðŸ§¡
